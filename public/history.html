    <h1 class="center">It all began in 1996...</h1>
    <p>
        I was born probabably with a tail that the doctors had to remove. When I was a child I was excited to go anywhere where 
        there was a dog whether that be a family gathering or visitng my dad's client and his pug. I never owned a dog myself until
        recently so I milked any opportunity to hang out with dogs.

    <p><h2 class="center">I've loved dogs for longer than I can remember</h2></p>

    <p>
        In 2015 I started walking dogs in Santa Monica through Rover before moving to San Francisco and getting my degree from SFSU in 
        Dog Walking (well technically business management).
