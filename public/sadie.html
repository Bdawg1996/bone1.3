    <p><h2>Dear Sadie,</h2></p>
    <p>
        You were the first dog that my family had gotten after many many years of my siblings and I wanting a dog of our own. You were the
        prettiest pitbull,  a very very sweet girl. You had a traumitizing past before we rescued you from the shelter. Unfortanutely that 
        led to you being a little rough around the edges, but certainly never violent. My family wasn't comfortable with the way you play 
        bit so we had to return you to the no kill shelter. I know you didn't have mean bones and if you were my full responsibility I would
        have trained you and loved you until you grew out of it. Thinking of you, I will never give up on any of your dog species friends that I work with no
        matter how difficult the situation may be. I know you're being a good girl Sadie wherever you are, and being loved for the sweet girl that you 
        are.
