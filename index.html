    At Bone Cadets, we pride ourselves on providing exceptional care and attention to every
    dog we have the privilege of walking. We understand that your furry companion is a cherished
    member of your family, and we treat them as such. We take the time to learn about your dog's
    unique likes, dislikes, and temperaments, tailoring our location and schedule to meet their needs.
    We incorporate basic behavior training during our walks, reinforcing positive behaviors and
    manners. We wake up every morning with a genuine love for animals and the integrity to make sure
    your furry friend is having their best day, everyday. Trust us to bring friends, exercise, and 
    happiness to their daily routine while promoting good behavior. Join our extended family today.

  <h2 class="center">You can also be sure of these three things:</h2>

  <ol>
   <li>
     <h3>No dog left behind</h3>
     <p>
       We won't give up on your dog. Not all dogs have pack experience, and we get that. We 
       believe in a "no dog left behind" approach, working patiently with dogs of all backgrounds 
       and experiences through various methods of training and reinforcement. Not to worry, we never 
       employ fear based tactics that can harm or scare your pet.
     </p> 
   </li>
  
    <li>
      <h3>An hour a day keeps the hard work away</h3>

      <p>
        Your dog will enjoy at least an hour of playtime with their packmates
        during each session. While pick-up and drop-off times may vary slightly due 
        to the route, we ensure your dog gets ample exercise and socialization.
      </p>

    <li>
     <h3>You will get photos of the cutest dog in the world (yours)!</h3>
     <p>
       This is the peanut butter off the spoon - We love capturing those moments of pure joy
       and excitement, and we'll gladly share them with you!
